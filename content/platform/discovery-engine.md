Our AI-Discovery Engine is a powerful, closed-loop system integrating predictive simulation, AI, and automated robotics. This creates an accelerated discovery loop—a synergistic process that dramatically shortens the design-test-learn cycle and delivers market-ready solutions with unprecedented speed.

## How It Works: Accelerating the Discovery Cycle

Our process is a continuous cycle of prediction, validation, and refinement.

### Step 1: Predictive Simulation – The Digital Twin

We begin by constructing a virtual 'digital twin' of your chemical challenge. This virtual environment allows us to de-risk and accelerate discovery by rapidly exploring hundreds of thousands of chemical pathways. Our computational engine uses large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, accelerated by advanced graph neural networks (GNNs), to identify the most promising candidates and reaction pathways from a vast chemical space.

*   **Ensuring Unparalleled Accuracy** 

Promising candidates and pathways identified by MD are then subjected to rigorous quantum mechanical calculations. Using a deep-learning Density Functional Theory (DFT) method, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/breaking-bonds-breaking-ground-advancing-the-accuracy-of-computational-chemistry-with-deep-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developed in collaboration with Microsoft Research</a>, we generate exceptionally accurate data on key structures and mechanisms. This process yields a purpose-built, high-confidence chemical database tailored specifically to your project.

*   **Training the Predictive AI** 

This high-quality database becomes the exclusive training ground for our sophisticated AI models. The AI learns the complex, underlying structure-property relationships within your specific system. The result is a highly accurate, predictive model ready to guide the next stages of automated experimental validation, dramatically reducing the experimental search space.

### Step 2: Automated Robotic Validation – The Real-World Test

The most promising candidates predicted by our AI are seamlessly transitioned from digital models to physical reality using a state-of-the-art robotics platform for high-throughput synthesis and characterization, allowing us to rapidly test the AI's hypotheses in the real world.

*   **The AI-Chem Robotics Network**
   Our AI discovery engine is directly integrated with the <a href="https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/Web/Grant/Grant/LE250100055" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$2.7M ARC-funded national AI-Chem Robotics Network</a> (LE250100055). This platform enables the parallel synthesis and analysis of hundreds of thousands of candidates and processes in parallel, generating crucial experimental data with exceptional speed and precision. This real-world data is then used to validate our computational models and provides the empirical foundation for the next cycle of refinement.

### Step 3: Closing the Loop: Self-Improving AI – The Accelerator

This is where the magic happens. The experimental results from the robotics platform are fed directly back into our simulation and AI workflows. This real-world data enriches our AI models, corrects for real-world complexities, and makes the next round of predictions even more accurate. This iterative optimization creates a powerful catalytic effect, accelerating discovery with each cycle and leading to a robust, market-ready solution.
