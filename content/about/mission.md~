Welcome to AATACC, an organisation dedicated to advancing the field of theoretical and computational chemistry across Australia. Established in 2009, our core mission is to foster a vibrant, collaborative, and world-class research community. We serve as a hub for students, researchers, and academics, promoting scientific excellence, supporting career development, and facilitating networking opportunities nationwide.

### Our Core Activities

AATACC supports the Australian theoretical and computational chemistry community through several key initiatives:

*   **Awards & Fellowships:** We recognize scientific excellence through our prestigious **[Distinguished Lecturers](/awards-funding/distinguished-lecturers/)** and **[International Fellows](/awards-funding/international-fellows/)** programs. These awards provide crucial support by enabling leading international experts to visit Australian institutions and share their knowledge.
*   **Community & Events:** We build a vibrant national network by providing seed funding and sponsorship for conferences, workshops, and symposia. These events bring researchers together at all career stages to share ideas, foster collaboration, and strengthen the Australian theoretical and computational chemistry community.
