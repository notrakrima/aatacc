Welcome to AATACC, an organisation dedicated to advancing the field of theoretical and computational chemistry across Australia. Established in 2009, our core mission is to foster a vibrant, collaborative, and world-class research community. We advance theoretical and computational chemistry in Australia by connecting our national community with global leaders, nurturing the next generation of researchers, and facilitating high-impact scientific exchange. 

### Our Core Activities

AATACC supports the Australian theoretical and computational chemistry community through several established programs and strategic initiatives:

* **Fostering International Connections:** We connect the Australian research community with world-leading computational chemists through our prestigious **[Distinguished Lecturers](/awards-funding/distinguished-lecturers/)** and **[International Fellows](/awards-funding/international-fellows/).** These initiatives facilitate visits that spark new collaborations, foster knowledge exchange, and ensure Australia remains at the forefront of the field

* **Nurturing Future Leaders:** We are dedicated to nurturing the next generation of researchers. Through targeted fellowships and awards, we support the career development of emerging researchers, ensuring a vibrant and sustainable future for theoretical and computational chemistry in Australia

* **Strengthening Our National Community:** AATACC is committed to strengthening the national network by fostering scientific dialogue that creates opportunities for researchers to share ideas, build collaborations, and advance theoretical and computational chemistry in Australia
